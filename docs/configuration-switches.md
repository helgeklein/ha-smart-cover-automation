# Configuration Guide: Switches

In addition to the rather static configuration settings managed through the wizard, the integration's behavior can be controlled via switches on the integration card:

- **Enabled:** Enables or disables the automation.
- **Simulation mode:** If enabled, the automation runs through all calculations without actually moving the covers.
- **Verbose logging:** Enables or disables detailed logging.

## Next Steps

After configuration, see the [Troubleshooting Guide]({{ '/troubleshooting/' | relative_url }}) for common issues and solutions.
