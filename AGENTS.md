# AGENTS.md

- This file contains instructions for autonomous coding agents.
- Read this before writing, editing, or executing anything in this repo.

## Preferred operating mode

- Ask before making changes: propose any change first. Only when the user accepts make actual changes to files in the repo.

## Testing instructions

- Add or update tests for new or changed code.
- When asked to fix test, only change tests, not the code they're testing.

## Coding style

- Add docstrings and inline comments for non-obvious code.
- Don't use magic strings or magic numbers. Use centrally defined constants, enums, or similar instead.

## Documentation

- Update documentation files intended for humans only when asked to. This includes:
    - Contributing.md
    - Readme.md
    - Testing.md
